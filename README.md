 ## Visualisation of student data for Assignment 1. IVIS - VT2022


The visualisation shows an overview of all the students using parallel coordinates that sorts up all attributes simultaneously.
The colors indicate different majors and each scale shows levels of different skills (self-evaluated). Skills are ordered in relation to each other, so nearby skills are closer.

Use brushes to drag up and down on the scales to filter out unwanted data using the ‘brushing-and-linking’ technique (Gavriel Salvendy, 2012). Click to select a specific student's path in order to see their details (on demand).
